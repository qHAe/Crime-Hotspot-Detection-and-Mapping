
# 🔍 Crime Hotspot Detection & Mapping 🗺️

This project is a data-driven exploration of urban crime patterns using spatial analysis, clustering algorithms, and predictive modeling techniques. It was developed as part of the **INT 375 - Data Science Toolbox** course to integrate GIS, machine learning, and visualization tools for practical crime trend analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect, analyze, and forecast crime hotspots in urban areas by:
- Cleaning and integrating multimodal crime datasets
- Identifying spatial crime clusters using K-Means and DBSCAN
- Generating crime density heatmaps through Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Forecasting future crime patterns using ARIMA and LSTM models
- Visualizing results in 3D using Kepler.gl
- Evaluating model performance through classification metrics
